## 📋 SECTION-BY-SECTION SCRIPT OUTLINE

### SECTION 1: INTRO (0:00-0:20)
**What to Say:**
- "BhashaQuest is an interactive language learning app"
- "Built with C++ and Qt6"
- "Teaches Nepali through engaging lessons and pronunciation grading"

**Key Point:** Problem → Solution → Tech Stack

---

### SECTION 2: FEATURES (0:20-1:00)
**Four Features to Highlight:**
1. **Lesson Navigation** (10s) - Structured by level
2. **Pronunciation Grading** (15s) - Automated speech evaluation
3. **Progress Tracking** (10s) - Real-time statistics
4. **User Profiles** (5s) - Multi-user support

**Key Point:** Each feature solves a learning problem

---

### SECTION 3: ARCHITECTURE (1:00-1:50)
**Technical Deep Dive:**
- **MVC Pattern** (15s) - Model, View, Controller separation
- **Domain Layer** (15s) - Exercise types & graders
- **Asset Management** (10s) - Offline audio files
- **Data Layer** (10s) - JSON-based persistence

**Key Point:** Clean architecture enables scalability

---

### SECTION 4: LIVE DEMO (1:50-3:20)
**Demo Sequence:**
1. **0:00-0:10** → Launch app
2. **0:10-0:30** → Show user profiles
3. **0:30-1:00** → Navigate lessons
4. **1:00-1:20** → Show pronunciation exercise
5. **1:20-1:30** → Show results/progress

**Backup:** Have screenshots ready if app crashes

---

### SECTION 5: HIGHLIGHTS (3:20-3:50)
**What We Learned:**
- ✅ Qt multimedia integration works great
- ✅ MVC architecture kept code clean
- ⚠️ Phonetic analysis needs fine-tuning
- 🚀 Future: Mobile, AI, adaptive difficulty

**Key Point:** Successes outweigh challenges

---

### SECTION 6: CLOSING (3:50-4:00+)
**Final Words:**
- "Technology makes language learning engaging"
- "Well-structured codebase ready for future work"
- "Ready for questions?"

---

## 🎯 DEMO CHECKLIST

- [ ] Application executable tested and working
- [ ] Sample user profiles created
- [ ] Navigate to Beginner Lesson 1
- [ ] Show at least one pronunciation exercise
- [ ] Return to profile view to show stats
- [ ] Screenshots saved as backup (in case of crash)
- [ ] Audio working (test before presentation)

## ⏰ TIMING DISCIPLINE GUIDE

### How to Stay On Time
- **Use a silent timer** (phone or watch) visible to you
- **Glance at timer every 30s** to ensure pacing
- **If running over:** Skip architecture details, cut demo short
- **If running under:** Expand Q&A or add interaction questions

### Red Flag Timings
- 🚩 At 1:50 you MUST start demo (or abandon it)
- 🚩 At 3:20 you MUST shift to highlights (or skip it)
- 🚩 At 3:50 you MUST begin closing (or cut short)

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

**If Demo Crashes:**
- [ ] Have screenshots ready on slide
- [ ] Say: "As you can see in this screenshot, here's the interface..."
- [ ] Continue with screenshots for ~60s
- [ ] Move to closing section

**If Running Over Time:**
- [ ] Skip detailed architecture explanation
- [ ] Reduce demo to 60s (app launch + quick feature show)
- [ ] Consolidate highlights into 10s summary
- [ ] Jump to Q&A

**If Audience Seems Confused:**
- [ ] Pause and ask: "Does this make sense so far?"
- [ ] Simplify explanation
- [ ] Use analogies (e.g., "Like Duolingo, but..."
- [ ] Move forward; save detail for Q&A

---

## ✅ PRE-PRESENTATION CHECKLIST (Day Before)

- [ ] Presentation slides finalized
- [ ] App tested on presentation computer
- [ ] Audio files working
- [ ] Screenshots captured as backup
- [ ] Script practiced (read through 2-3 times)
- [ ] Timing rehearsed (full run-through)
- [ ] Backup slides prepared (in case of questions)
- [ ] Presentation file location confirmed
- [ ] Laptop battery/power checked
- [ ] Presentation mode tested (projector/screen)
